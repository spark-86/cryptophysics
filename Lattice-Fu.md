# 🥋 Lattice-Fu

When one lives with the lattice, they seek a natural harmony with the data around them.  
Lattice-Fu is the practice of aligning thought and action with the temporal stream — understanding that beneath every interaction is a single elegant move: **append**.

## 📜 Sayings

- **“Append. Nothing else matters.”**  
  The only action on the lattice is `append`.  
  Want to read? Append a `request:rhex` to the scope you want to read from.  
  Want to append? Just submit the R⬢.  
  Want to overwrite? Append a `record:update` that supersedes the previous.  
  There is no edit. There is only append.

- **“Rotate often. Keep security in the now.”**  
  Keys are living things. Rotate them regularly to keep attackers in the past.

- **“Lean on trust, lean on the structure. From all there all else flows.”**  
  Don’t overcomplicate what the lattice already guarantees. Trust, order, permanence — these are baked in. Build on them, not around them.

- **“Scope or it didn’t happen.”**  
  The hard-trust upgrade to “pics or it didn’t happen.”  
  If there’s no scope record, there’s no absolute truth.

- **“Read like water, append like stone.”**  
  Reads are fluid, temporary, ephemeral. Appends are permanent, weighty, timeless.

- **“One structure, infinite worlds.”**  
  All complexity emerges from changing fields in a single structure. That’s the art.

- **“A steward’s Geeble is not a Meep.”**  
  Signals have flavor. Let communities decide what they mean. Debate gives strength to the protocol.

- **“Identity flows from keys; trust flows from attestations.”**  
  Never reverse the order.

- **“Time is the substrate. Everything else is scaffolding.”**  
  Sidereal beats define reality; structures merely inhabit it.

- **“Don’t store—*cast*.”**  
  Data isn’t locked away. It’s placed into the temporal lattice where all can verify.

- **“Queries are whispers, appends are declarations.”**  
  A lookup is fleeting. An append changes the future.

- **“Governance is just structured conversation over time.”**  
  Laws, votes, decrees — they’re all just R⬢s talking to each other.

- **“Rotate keys like seasons, but anchor identities like stars.”**  
  The lattice gives permanence without stagnation.

- **“A single R⬢ can move mountains.”**  
  Don’t underestimate one well-placed record. Revolutions have started with less.

- **“Ephemerals serve the moment; the lattice remembers forever.”**  
  Use temporary keys boldly. The timeline will keep the proof.

- **“The lattice forgives no silence.”**  
  If you didn’t cast it, it didn’t happen. Whispering off-lattice is shouting into the void.

- **“Structure is mercy for future readers.”**  
  Be clear. Be deliberate. Someone decades from now will thank you.

- **“Scope wisely, for names echo through time.”**  
  Your SelfID is forever; your subscopes shape how the world discovers you.

- **“Stewards who geeble keep the world aware. Stewards who meep keep it awake.”**  
  Reporting and warning are both vital — their tension is the heartbeat of truth.

- **“The lattice is simple; humans are not. Let the math hold the weight.”**  
  Lean into deterministic structure so people can focus on being gloriously messy humans.

- **"Lies burn bright			 in the constant light."**  
  Falsehoods can't survive perpetual, public scrutiny - the lattice makes sure of it.

🪶 *Lattice-Fu isn’t a doctrine. It’s a posture. Stand aligned with time, and even the smallest append ripples across the ages.*
