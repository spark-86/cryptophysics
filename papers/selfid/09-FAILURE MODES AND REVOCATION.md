# **Chapter 9 — Failure Modes and Revocation**

No system is immune to failure. Keys are lost. Devices break. Credentials are compromised. People act maliciously. Organizations dissolve. The durability of any identity framework depends not on the absence of failure, but on **how it responds when failure occurs**.

In traditional identity systems, failure recovery relies on central authorities: password resets through a company, reissuance of passports by governments, or manual administrative intervention. In a ledger-native identity system, recovery must be **decentralized, transparent, and robust**—without compromising security or depending on trusted intermediaries.

This chapter explores the failure modes of SelfID, the revocation and recovery mechanisms designed to handle them, and how transparency sustains trust in the face of inevitable human and technical errors.

## **9.1 The Nature of Failure in Identity Systems**

Identity failures generally fall into a few categories:

1. **Key Loss:** The private key is lost or destroyed. The identity remains valid on the ledger, but the user can no longer sign.
2. **Key Compromise:** The private key falls into the wrong hands, enabling unauthorized actions.
3. **Signer Misbehavior:** A trusted attestation source issues false claims, acts maliciously, or is compromised.
4. **Organizational Collapse:** A collective identity dissolves, leaving orphaned attestations and policies.
5. **Social or Political Disputes:** Identities are contested due to factional splits, schisms, or legal conflicts.

Each failure mode requires different tools and social mechanisms to resolve while maintaining **ledger integrity** and avoiding centralized overrides.

## **9.2 Revocation Records**

The cornerstone of failure handling is the **revocation record**. Just as every action on the ledger is explicit, so too is undoing or disabling an action.

A revocation record is a signed R⬢ entry stating that a key, attestation, or delegation is no longer valid. Types include:

* **`key:revoke`** — Declares a key no longer valid for signing.
* **`attest:revoke`** — Revokes a previously issued attestation.
* **`delegation:revoke`** — Cancels delegated authority.

Revocations reference the original record by its hash and include a timestamp, signer, and optional reason. Anyone can verify revocations by resolving the chain.

This **append-only revocation model** ensures that nothing is silently erased. Trust depends on transparency, not deletion.

## **9.3 Key Loss and Recovery**

Key loss is the most common identity failure. A hardware device is destroyed, a seed phrase is misplaced, or encrypted backups are lost.

Because keys are the cryptographic anchors of identity, losing them traditionally means losing access permanently. SelfID introduces several recovery strategies to mitigate this:

### **Backup Keys**

Generate secondary keys stored offline or with trusted hardware. If the primary key is lost, issue a `key:grant` for the backup and a `key:revoke` for the lost key.

### **Pre-authorized Recovery Keys**

Establish recovery keys at the time of SelfID creation. These keys hold no operational authority unless a revocation event occurs. Upon loss, the recovery key issues a signed recovery record, granting new operational keys.

### **Social Recovery**

Designate a group of trusted peers to serve as recovery signers. A quorum (e.g., 3 of 5) can jointly sign a key rotation record. This mirrors real-world trust: identity recovery depends on community support, not a password reset email.

### **Temporal Safeguards**

Recovery actions can include time delays, allowing public observers to challenge fraudulent recovery attempts before they finalize.

---

## **9.4 Key Compromise and Containment**

When a key is compromised, **speed and transparency** are critical. The moment compromise is detected, a `key:revoke` record should be issued using another authorized key or recovery quorum.

The ledger makes containment straightforward:

* All signatures after the compromise timestamp can be flagged as suspect.
* Services relying on the ledger can automatically reject new signatures from the revoked key.
* Observers can trace which actions were performed using the compromised key and respond accordingly.

Unlike centralized systems where revocation depends on administrator intervention, **any observer can verify** the status of a key independently.

---

## **9.5 Attestation Revocation and Trust Dynamics**

When an attestation turns out to be false or compromised, it too must be revoked. The signer issues an `attest:revoke` record, citing the original attestation hash. This allows anyone relying on that attestation to adjust their trust calculations.

Revoking attestations doesn’t erase history; it marks it. Trust algorithms can factor in revocations to downgrade VeroScores or alert dependent systems.

If a signer **refuses** to revoke a false attestation, others can issue **counter-attestations**, challenging the claim. This creates a **public dispute trail** that others can evaluate.

---

## **9.6 Misbehaving Signers and Reputation Cascades**

A particularly dangerous failure mode occurs when a **trusted attester misbehaves**—for example, a university issuing fake credentials or a DAO signing malicious proposals.

SelfID’s transparency turns such failures into **socially visible events**:

* Revocations and counter-attestations form a verifiable evidence trail.
* Organizations that refuse to revoke false claims expose themselves to public scrutiny.
* VeroScores of misbehaving signers drop as their network issues counter-attestations.

This decentralized, reputation-driven containment avoids the need for a single “root of truth.” Trust is recalculated dynamically based on visible behavior.

---

## **9.7 Organizational Collapse and Identity Orphans**

What happens when an organization ceases to exist? In traditional systems, its credentials become unverifiable or are frozen by the state. On the ledger, the identity remains—but its keys may go silent.

Strategies for handling organizational collapse include:

* **Preplanned dissolution protocols:** Publish a quorum-signed `organization:dissolve` record.
* **Delegated archival authorities:** Transfer verification powers to partner institutions or a trust archive.
* **Attestation expiration:** Set attestations to expire automatically if not renewed.

These measures prevent trust webs from depending indefinitely on dead keys or abandoned identities.

---

## **9.8 Disputes, Forks, and Schisms**

Collectives sometimes split. Two factions may both claim to be the legitimate successor of an original identity. Traditional systems handle this through legal adjudication; ledger systems handle it through **public lineage and attestations**.

Both factions can issue records staking their claims. Observers can evaluate:

* Which group controls the original keys or valid delegated successors.
* Which group retains more attestations and support from peers.
* Which lineage of records forms the most coherent causal chain.

No one needs to issue a decree; the **evidence speaks for itself**. Different observers may choose different forks, but the transparency prevents hidden coups.

---

## **9.9 Social Recovery Strategies**

Technical mechanisms alone aren’t enough. Identity is social. **Social recovery** involves embedding recovery responsibilities in trusted relationships:

* Designating recovery peers at SelfID creation.
* Rotating recovery responsibilities over time.
* Embedding recovery actions in organizational governance.

This mirrors real-world practices: communities vouch for and help restore their members. It also avoids central backdoors: recovery requires multiple trusted peers, not a single reset button.

---

## **9.10 Transparency as the Core of Trust**

The key to all these failure modes is **transparency**. In traditional systems, revocations happen behind closed doors. Users are notified—or not—depending on administrative discretion. In SelfID, revocations are **ledger records**:

* Publicly visible.
* Timestamped.
* Verifiable by anyone.

This transparency turns failure from a hidden vulnerability into a **publicly manageable event**. Trust doesn’t depend on perfection; it depends on the ability to see and respond to imperfection.

---

## **9.11 No Central Gatekeepers**

Crucially, none of these failure and revocation mechanisms depend on central authorities. Recovery keys, quorum signatures, social recovery, and transparent revocations all function without a helpdesk or government office.

This doesn’t mean there’s no governance—communities still decide who to trust—but it means recovery and revocation are **distributed processes** anchored in cryptography and social networks, not bureaucratic hierarchies.

---

## **9.12 Summary**

Failure is inevitable. What matters is how systems respond. SelfID’s recovery and revocation mechanisms—key rotation, social recovery, attestation revocation, dispute transparency, and organizational dissolution protocols—provide a **decentralized toolkit** for handling identity failures without central gatekeepers.

Revocation is not erasure; it’s **recorded adjustment**. Transparency turns failure into information, enabling communities and systems to adapt trust dynamically. This resilience is what allows ledger-native identity to persist over decades, even as individuals, organizations, and technologies change.
