# **Preface — The Right to Be Known, Truthfully**

Identity has always been mediated—by states, corporations, guilds, churches. For centuries, who you were depended on who was willing to vouch for you. A birth certificate stamped by a registrar. A passport issued by a government. A student ID card from a university. A platform login blessed by a corporation’s authentication server. All of these systems place an intermediary between you and the world. Your existence, in practical terms, has been defined by others’ ledgers.

**SelfID flips the table.** You become the authority of yourself. Your name, your keys, your attestations, your proofs. No registrar required, no gatekeeper’s nod. It’s not rebellion for rebellion’s sake—it’s a structural inversion. Authority flows from you outward, anchored cryptographically and temporally rather than bureaucratically.

This is not just another digital ID scheme or a shiny new login method. SelfID is the **scaffolding for civilization‑scale trust**. Where usernames and passwords were a patchwork of trust assumptions, SelfID is a foundation: a verifiable root from which identities, relationships, and governance can grow without relying on fragile, centralized intermediaries.

With SelfID, a person can anchor their identity in time and cryptographic fact, creating a record that is portable across borders, platforms, and eras. Attestations from others form a web of trust around this anchor—not a cage, but a lattice. It allows reputation to be earned through deeds, verified transparently, and preserved beyond the lifespan of any single institution.

To be known truthfully is to hold authorship of your own story, with evidence to back it. SelfID makes that possible.
