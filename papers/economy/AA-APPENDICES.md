### **A. Mathematical Models of Lie Propagation in Lattices**

Understanding how lies propagate in lattice systems requires formal modeling. Traditional epidemiological models—such as SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered)—can be adapted to describe the spread of deceptive claims. In these models:

* **Susceptible nodes** represent identities that have not encountered the claim.
* **Infected nodes** represent identities that have accepted or repeated the lie.
* **Recovered nodes** represent those that have verified and rejected it.

The key difference from traditional information ecosystems lies in the **verification vector**. In legacy systems, verification is slow and centralized, leading to high basic reproduction numbers (R₀) for lies. In a lattice, recursive verification accelerates recovery and immunization, dramatically lowering R₀ over time.

Mathematically, we model:

[ R_0 = \frac{\beta}{\gamma} ]

where ( \beta ) is the transmission rate of a lie (how quickly it spreads) and ( \gamma ) is the verification rate (how quickly contradictions are discovered and attached). Lattices increase ( \gamma ) through automated agents, layered attestations, and temporal anchoring, pushing ( R_0 < 1 ) and forcing deception to die out rather than becoming endemic.

Complex network models further refine this by incorporating **degree distributions**, **reputation weights**, and **temporal lags**, showing how high-reputation nodes have outsized influence on propagation but also on recovery.

### **B. Ledger Schemas for Arbitration Records**

Arbitration records in a lattice must follow structured schemas to ensure verifiability, interoperability, and recursion. A typical arbitration record might contain:

```json
{
  "record_type": "arbitration",
  "scope": "dispute.supplychain.example",
  "previous_hash": "abc123...",
  "arbitration_id": "arb-2025-09-0034",
  "disputed_records": ["hash1", "hash2"],
  "panel": ["keyA", "keyB", "keyC"],
  "findings": {
    "verdict": "record hash1 is false",
    "evidence": ["counter-hash-1", "counter-hash-2"]
  },
  "signatures": [
    {"signer": "keyA", "sig": "..."},
    {"signer": "keyB", "sig": "..."},
    {"signer": "keyC", "sig": "..."}
  ],
  "timestamp": "GT[1274.12.03@451]",
  "current_hash": "xyz789..."
}
```

This schema ensures that arbitration decisions are:

* Cryptographically linked to the disputed records.
* Traceable to the arbiters’ identities.
* Anchored in time.
* Recursively referenceable by future records.

Different scopes can customize schemas with domain-specific fields (e.g., scientific peer review vs. supply-chain dispute), but the structural invariants—signatures, temporal anchoring, and linkage to evidence—remain constant.

### **C. Game-Theoretic Analyses of Liar Strategies**

Lattice systems can be analyzed through the lens of game theory, where liars and verifiers engage in strategic interaction. We can model this as a **repeated signaling game**:

* **Players**: Liars (signalers) and verifiers (receivers).
* **Strategies for liars**: Tell the truth (T), Tell a cheap lie (L₁), Tell an expensive sophisticated lie (L₂).
* **Strategies for verifiers**: Verify immediately (V), Delay verification (D), Trust without verification (T).

The payoffs change dramatically under lattice conditions. Cheap lies (L₁) yield diminishing returns as automated verification catches them early. Sophisticated lies (L₂) are costly and risky. Telling the truth often yields the highest long-term payoff due to reputation accumulation.

Over repeated games, equilibria shift toward **truth-telling Nash equilibria**, where the cost of deception outweighs its benefits. Verifiers are incentivized to act promptly because recursive verification multiplies their influence.

Evolutionary game theory further shows that liar strategies decline in population frequency over time as feedback loops penalize deception.

### **D. Example VeroScore Trust Decay Models**

VeroScore (or equivalent reputation metrics) governs how trust decays in response to proven lies. Several decay models can be implemented depending on scope policies:

1. **Linear Decay**: Reputation decreases by a fixed amount per proven lie.
2. **Exponential Decay**: Each subsequent lie causes proportionally greater damage, reflecting compounding distrust.
3. **Threshold Collapse**: Reputation remains stable until a threshold number of deceptions, after which it collapses sharply.

For example, under exponential decay:

[ R_{t+1} = R_t \times (1 - d)^n ]

where ( d ) is the decay rate per lie and ( n ) is the number of proven lies. This model heavily penalizes repeat offenders while allowing isolated errors to have limited impact.

Decay curves can be scope-specific. Scientific scopes may penalize a single falsified dataset harshly. Social scopes may allow for more gradual decay, reflecting the difference between fraud and honest error.

### **E. Historical Timeline of Lie Economies vs. Technological Substrates**

The economy of lies has evolved alongside technological substrates:

| Era                      | Substrate              | Dominant Deception Mode                          | Verification Cost Dynamics                            |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Pre-literate             | Oral traditions        | Myth-making, rumor                               | High; evidence ephemeral                              |
| Medieval                 | Seals, parchment       | Forged documents, monopolized literacy           | Verification centralized, slow                        |
| Print Era                | Printing press         | Propaganda pamphlets                             | Verification delayed by logistics                     |
| Telegraph / Early Modern | Telegraph, newspapers  | Rapid rumor cascades, market manipulation        | Faster spread, verification lags                      |
| Broadcast                | Radio, television      | State propaganda, mass persuasion                | Verification centralized, slow feedback               |
| Digital                  | Internet, social media | Viral misinformation, bots, deepfakes            | Production cheap, verification expensive              |
| Lattice                  | Cryptographic ledgers  | Fossilized lies, timing attacks, swarm deception | Verification automated, recursion collapses asymmetry |

Each substrate reshaped the cost curves of deception and verification. The lattice represents a discontinuity: a structural inversion of historical asymmetries. Lies persist, but their economics shift from cheap and systemic to costly and marginal.
